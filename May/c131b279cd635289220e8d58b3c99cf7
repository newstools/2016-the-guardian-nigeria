To this end, large corporations are even concerned on eliminating time wasting and cost inefficient transaction processes, which FinTrak Software Company Limited has underscored as achievable with her flagship Enterprise Resource Management System (ERMS). Speaking at a workshop for bank chief executives and other clienteles, Mr. Bimbo Abioye, group managing director of Company told Nigeria CommunicationsWeek that the ERMS has become ubiquitous for improved transaction turnaround time for multinationals to achieve more with less costs through mobile transactions, online transactions and other electronic devices. He said that inspite available technologies, some organization still engage very cumbersome processes due to manual operations, adding that automation is the only solution for such to achieve efficient processes.
