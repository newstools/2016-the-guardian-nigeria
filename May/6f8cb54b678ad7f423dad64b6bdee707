Coconut oil in plastic bottles Low capital for start-up Some people, especially ladies and nursing mothers, are beginning to be wary of the chemical contents of some imported cosmetic products, particularly cream and lotions made for women and children. Entertaining fears that some synthetic elements found in these industrial cosmetic products, according to medical reports, could cause serious ailments such as cancer, as well as damage sensitive internal organs, if used for a long period, this category of people may have been persuaded to resort to using natural oil extract from fruits, nuts and seeds. This is usually mixed with sweet smelling fragrance for use as daily skin care products. Undertaking the production of this natural body oils and creams are some businessmen and women, who are bottling and packaging extracts for different segments of the market. Rita Ewudo, a dealer in coconut oil, describes it as a wonderful product, which offers different health benefits. And people, including nursing mothers buy it for different purposes. Enumerating some of the health benefits of coconut oil, Ewudo explains that some people prefer it to palm oil, melon or groundnut oil, as the saturated nature of coconut oil makes it easy for digestion. “Because of these health benefits, some people prefer to use it for frying, as well as for cooking sauces and soups. They say it increases levels of such good fats as high-density lipoproteins (HDL), while decreasing the bad ones such as low-density lipoproteins (LDL). This aids in trimming the waist. Coconut oil is also said to contain lauric, a fatty acid, which boosts the immune system, enabling it fight diseases and antibodies. “Others buy the oil because it helps them shed excess weight without having to fast or exercise. This is because the oil is said to contain nutrients that increase the rate of metabolism by breaking down food faster for the body to absorb,” she says. Ewudo explains that she makes between N40, 000 and N70, 000 monthly, as profits from sales, though getting the oil does not come easy. According to her, to get 25 litres of coconut oil, one has to buy almost two and a half bags of mature coconut, which have to be broken and then grated. This process is quite tough. “Getting the oil is demanding and one has to look for the fastest means of doing this, especially as it is for commercial purposes. Also, one has to look for cheaper alternatives, while putting premium on high quality. To achieve this, it is advisable to get only mature coconuts, which some traders may not always want to sell,” she explains. Commenting on reasons why some nursing mothers and ladies prefer natural coconut oil and shea butter to the different cosmetic products that abound in the market, Bisi Afolayan, a cosmetologist, says natural oils make the skin smoother and softer. According to her, with regular use of these products, stretch marks and rashes are quickly cleared. She explains that both could be used plain or mixed with sweet smelling fragrances and used as creams daily after bath. “Shea butter and coconut oil have moisturising elements and regular use could effectively treat different skin problems such as wrinkles, small skin blemishes, wounds, insect bites, itching, eczema and skin allergies among others,” she says. For Malomo Okanlanwa, who sells herbs, coconut oil, shea butter and palm kernel oil (adi agbon in Yoruba) are some of the soothing oils most African homes cannot do without. According to her, mixing two of the oils with alligator pepper and other items as may be prescribed by traditional healers, could revive a child after convulsion, fever and even measles. Explaining reasons why these oils are expensive, Okanlawon says she gets her supplies from the rural areas and so has to recoup her capital, as well as, make some profit. According to her, a 500ml bottle of coconut goes for N500 and N700, while 750ml goes for between N750 and N1, 000 or more, depending on the market and time of purchase. “Adi agbon is quite different from other oils, as one cannot prepare it in his/her kitchen. A more spacious place is needed to prepare it, to avoid fire hazard. It is because of the way it comes that makes the product scarce and expensive. “Despite the cost, I make between N20, 000 and N30, 000 monthly as gains from adi agbon. People mix it with Shea butter to improve their skin, as well as ward off mosquitoes. It can also be mixed with other herbs to keep the body warm during cold weather. Indeed, it is highly medicinal,” she explains. So, what does it take to start coconut oil and shea butter business? Rahmeed Lasisi says the business is very profitable, easy to start and can be done from one’s home. According to him, producing coconut oil involves less capital than other coconut products. One thing though, the individual must be well informed before venturing into it. He/she must also get the right training and be willing to start on a small scale. With about N80, 000, any interested person can start the production of shea butter and coconut oil. “Training is very important, as it helps to equip one with different processing methods. It also enables one to produce high quality coconut oil, as well as how to mix it with fragrances and other oils, with quick production time. “Aside training, knowing where and how to get regular supply of healthy coconut is equally important. It is advisable to go for cheaper seeds, though quality must never be compromised because the cheaper one gets the nuts, the lower the quality and most times, the better the turnover,” she explains. Disclosing that it is one thing to produce high quality item and another thing to sell it, Mike Unuegbe, who deals in different fruits and seed oils, explains that a well-packaged oil or Shea butter products would sell very fast. According to him, how one packages his/her product determines its appeal and subsequently the selling rate. Advising producers, he says they should package their products in such a way that it would easily attract buyers. And this starts from the bottle, labels and literature. “They should also put contact address and cell phone numbers on the label or the bottle, as these are marks of guarantee that the producer is confident of his/her product. “Again, they should never underestimate their reach, which is the main reason the necessary contacts should be there. Provide information on ingredients used, as well as clear instructions on how to use the product. Doing this does not mean giving away trade secret. Rather, it promotes the product, especially since the quantity of ingredient used is not stated. Failure to do this is the reason most local products do not get beyond local markets,” he says. On how to make good sales, Adijatu Ahmed says she takes her coconut and shea butter products to such places as primary health centres, which are highly patronised by mothers that take their children for treatment. I also go to local government councils, religious gatherings, beauty centres and sometimes, display my ware by roadside. “Because I know the efficacy of my products, I take them to mothers at health centres and it has been working wonders for me. I get regular calls and people come from different places to buy from me. I make between N70, 000 and N80, 000 monthly selling different oils. However, it is better having a shop in such popular places as hospitals, as this gives more visibility and patronage,” she explains. What It Takes To Excel
