The President of the association, Bola Bido stated that there is need to imbibe maintenance culture as a norm, adding that lack of maintenance culture has been attributed as reason responsible for the fold-up of some companies in the country. He said the call became necessary as a result of the present dwindling economic activities in the country.Bido however called on the members to brace up for greater challenges ahead as the engineering profession should bring out its best during economic downturn by sustaining the critical aviation infrastructure with minimal resources. He also challenged engineers in the aviation sector not to rest on their oars as there was a great task of transforming the sector through ingenuity adding that the era of analogue was over as every sector has been digitilised. Bido therefore urged engineers to continue to play leading roles in all agencies in the aviation sector as the industry was being driven by technology manned by engineers.He cautioned that no technical issues should be allowed to affect safety in any form, notwithstanding the challenges in the system.
