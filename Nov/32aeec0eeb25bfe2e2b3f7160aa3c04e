Emadeb Energy Services Limited As part of its growth strategy, Emadeb Energy Services Limited, a Petroleum Products Haulage and Petroleum Products Distribution Company, has ventured into retail outlets through which it plans to increase earnings. The Chief Operating Officer of the company, Mrs Kike Ojo-Awosika, said in a statement that one of the 20 retail outlets, which the company is targeting to build nationwide in the next 18 months subject to the outlook in the downstream sector, would be commissioned in Abuja on Friday. She said the decision to build the retail outlets, the significant percentage of which would be sited in Abuja, Lagos and some southern cities, stemmed from “our growth strategy and the commitment to taking our business to the next level, following the commissioning of our ultra modern Tank Farm in February 2014.” According to her, “Prior to now, Emadeb Energy has specialised in the importation, storage and distribution of refined petroleum products, particularly Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), which forms more than 60 per cent of the total import in the sector.”
She explained that ownership of retail outlets would enable the company to enjoy economies of scale, which would, in the long run, increase turnover/margins. Ojo-Awosika, who expressed confidence that the market is beckoning on the company, declared that “we currently have clients across the six geo-political zones in the country and it is important we take our services to their doorstep.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
