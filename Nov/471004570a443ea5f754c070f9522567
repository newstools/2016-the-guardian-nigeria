Dakuku Peterside, NIMASA Boss The House of Representatives Committee on Maritime Safety, Education and Administration has urged the management of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) to spend the funds appropriated in the 2016 budget according to the provisions of the law, in other to actualize the value of the projects. The Chairman of the committee, Mohammed Umar Bago, who disclosed this during an oversight visit to the agency, also challenged the agency’s on its budget implementation stating that the committee expects over 90 per cent implementation of the budget. Bago assured the unflinching support of members to enable the Agency deliver on its mandate in ensuring the growth and development of the maritime sector, especially now that the country is in a recession. The chairman called on the Agency not to see the visit as punitive but as a wakeup call, noting that, “in the eighth Assembly, the legislative agenda is the same. All of us apply the same approach now in trying to bring out the best in our parastatal. We should not be seen as vindictive or punitive but as partners in progress.” The Director General of NIMASA, Dr. Dakuku Peterside, assured the committee of the agency’s readiness to cooperate with the Committee in the interest of the maritime industry and the country as a whole. According to the DG, “when you are given an assignment, you are expected to be accountable, you are expected to conduct the assignment in a transparent manner. The oversight function today is part of the accountability responsibility on our side. The National Assembly appropriates for us so we are expected to be accountable. And so we have given account of our stewardship. “The National Assembly may not have been totally satisfied with what we have done but they appreciate that a lot is being done to change the narrative in NIMASA”.
