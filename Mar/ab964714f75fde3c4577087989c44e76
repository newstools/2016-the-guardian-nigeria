The judge convicted the defendant following his plea of guilty to a two-count charge of possession of documents containing false pretense preferred against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The anti-graft counsel, Mr. A. A. Adebayo, told the court that the commission received a petition from ‘a concerned Nigerian’ who refused to disclose his identity, “that a group of small boys living at different apartments located at Westwood Estate, Lekki, Ajah, Badore in Lagos, were living far beyond their means of livelihood.” He further told the court that after carrying out preliminary investigation, EFCC operatives swooped on Westwood Estate on January 7, and arrested Frank. The presiding judge while sentencing warned Frank against going back to crime and sentenced him to two years imprisonment to take effect from January 6, 2015, the date the defendant was arrested and detained by the EFCC.
