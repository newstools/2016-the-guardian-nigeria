The MoU, according to a statement, is a natural consequence of Arla’s engagement in “The Milky Way to Development”, an alliance led by CARE to develop a socially, environmentally and economically sustainable market for milk in West Africa. According to the firm, the move to commence local production is in fulfillment of the promise of Arla’s Chief Executive Officer, PederTuborgh that Arla would be stepping up its efforts in Nigeria, as the country is one of the six markets in which Arla plans to concentrate under a programme dubbed, “Strategy 2020” announced by the company in December 2015. “Arla is officially committed to investing in local dairy production in Nigeria and to sharing knowledge about agricultural practices and other aspects of dairy production that will improve the local raw milk production and quality in Nigeria. The purpose is to contribute to a sustainable dairy sector development and growth in Nigeria”, the statement read in part. Head of Arla’s regional office in sub-Saharan Africa, Steen Hadsbjerg, at the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding during the visit of a Danish business delegation to Nigeria arranged by the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, explained that the move by Arla will contribute to the sustainable development and growth of Nigeria’s dairy sector. “In order for Arla to have a long-term successful business in Nigeria, it is important that we engage in the development of the local dairy sector. The Nigerian government looks very positively on the companies that commit to taking a local responsibility and help create a better balance between imported and locally produced dairy products in the market,” says Steen Hadsbjerg.
