This commitment was made by Yusuf Kazaure, the company’s managing director/CEO while delivering a speech at the 14th Innovation Africa Digital (IAD) Summit 2016 which held in Abuja recently. According to Kazaure, “We are fully conscious of the need to be in the vanguard of Nigeria’s digital growth especially within the public sector. Over the years, we have made significant investments in human and technological resources based on our vision to be the leading enabler of digital inclusion in Africa”. He told the audience at the summit that harnessing Africa’s digital growth was a key challenge facing African leaders both in government and business. Hence, there was the need for high-level dialogue that would draw attention to the nature of decisions and actions necessary for the digital transformation of the continent for a better future. He therefore challenged policy makers, regulators, service providers, solutions providers and ICT experts on the continent to leverage the huge investments already made in ICTs to innovate and induce organic growth in Africa.
