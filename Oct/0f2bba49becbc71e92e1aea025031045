It is said that the only thing constant in life is change, and when one looks around the immediate environment this can be seen to be true. Nowhere is this more evident than in the banking industry. Over the last two decades, the number of bank customers has grown and as the numbers have grown, so also have their lifestyles and behaviours evolved. Gone are the days of lining up patiently with your tally number at a bank, simply because you did not have a choice. This customer lifestyle evolution has made innovations in financial products and services delivery a necessity, as banks have to create, and recreate financial products to be in line with current social and business realities; and, ensure that these product innovations meet the rapidly changing choices of the customer. The importance of this is highlighted as the first week in October is celebrated as Customer Service Week around the World. Businesses and organizations carry out special events to highlight the importance of their customers and show appreciation to how they have contributed to the success of the organization and reinforce a customer-focused culture.
