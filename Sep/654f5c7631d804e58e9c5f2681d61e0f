To build the capacity of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the oil and gas sector across the Niger Delta, the Nigeria Agip Oil Company (NAOC/ENI), said over 730 vendors have been trained so far under its capacity development initiatives programmes. Disclosing this at the opening ceremony of a two-day Business Leadership Workshop organised by the oil giant for small and medium scale business vendors, the Vice Chairman/Managing Director, Massimo Insula, said it was geared towards entrenching small and medium scale businesses for community content and sustainability. Represented by Manager, Nigeria Content Coordination District, Albert Ijuiwe, said the workshop is designed to be an inspirational programme for business excellence as part of efforts to build their capacities. During the two-day workshop, he said selected business role models will make presentation to participating vendors, telling their success stories, challenges and critical factors to business survival and sustainability in the prevailing Nigerian economic environment, especially in the oil and gas sector of the oil rich region. He said: “You will recall that in the past, as part of capacity development Initiatives, we have concentrated on Vendors Development Programme with 360 vendors trained so far, Vendors Awareness and Sensitisation Engagement, with 250 trained so far as well as Exhibition, Gap closure and Opportunities Engagements, where 120 vendors participated. Starting from 2016, we are diversifying into other areas of capacity development. Specifically, we are focused on developing and building capacities in the areas of small and medium businesses and community content with include, business development, succession planning workshop and indigenous technology forum.” Insula also used the opportunity to enumerate some of the initiatives of AGIP/ENI in the areas of promoting Nigeria Content Development and corporate social responsibility, which he sad include the pioneering of an independent power plant to add to the national grid, which helped stimulate the economy. “As a responsible corporate citizens, Eni has continued to ensure strict compliance with the provision of the NOGICD Act by issuing internal guidelines that make it mandatory that all departments involved in contracting processes must liaise with the Nigerian Content Division in order to cross check full adherence to the provision of the act. Chairman of the Bayelsa State Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Jonathan Omu, in his keynote address, said the current economic situation rather than dampen us, Nigerians should use the opportunity to rejuvenate, rekindle and transform themselves and the system to archive success especially the vast opportunities in the agricultural sector. He urged participants to have a greater vision and take the opportunity offered by the workshop to build themselves into the global commerce of the world and refuse to play the second fiddle or referral role.
