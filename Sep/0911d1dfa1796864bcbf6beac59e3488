Challenges facing the aviation sector notwithstanding, the Cross Rivers State Government, yesterday, said all was set for the floating of a state-own airline. The State Governor, Ben Ayade, on Monday, said “Cally Air’’, as the new airline is called, is part of its tourism investment drive. Addressing a consortium of Indian investors, Ayade said the airline would be managed by the Dana Group, under a Public Private Partnership arrangement. The Governor said the airline is expected to debut in November, and would fly Calabar, Obudu, Lagos and Abuja routes. According to him, “We have our own state’s aircraft currently in Aero Contractors’ fleet in Lagos. The management of Dana Airline has agreed to do a detailed technical study of the aircraft before it commences commercial flight operations.” Ayade added that the state was in a haste to get the airline started with Dana as its partner. The Managing Director of Dana Group, Jackies Hartmani, applauded the partnership between his group and the state government. Hartmani said: “My company is very impressed with what Governor Ayade is doing to transform the state in terms of investment, and we are committed to ensuring the success of the partnership,’’ he said.
