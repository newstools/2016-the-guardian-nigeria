Ms Hadiza Usman The Senior Staff Association of the Nigerian Ports Authority(NPA), has urged the new Managing Director, Ms Hadiza Usman, to make the refloating of the agency`s training school one of her priorities. The President of the association, Mr Benson Adegbeyeni, made the plea in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. He said the revival of the now moribund school would help in the capacity building of NPA personnel as well as help boost the needed manpower in the maritime industry. “The need for the refloating of the NPA training school cannot be over-emphasised. “Apart from helping to develop the capacity of existing staff in the various operations of the organisation, it will also help to train people who are non-staff of the organisation,’’ Adegbeyeni said. He said that this would ultimately help to improve the human capacity in the maritime industry. “We hope the new management would make that project one of their priorities. If the school is revived, it will definitely going to be in the overall interest of NPA, “he said. The association’s president said that the revival of the school would also help to enhance the revenue profile of the NPA as it would attract trainees from other organizations. Adegbeyeni commended the choice of Usman as the organisation`s new head and assured that staff would give her the necessary support toward moving NPA forward.
